# fire-jumper-elite-badge
CircuitPython code for Fall 2019 FJE Badge

As a way to reward our amazing Fire Jumper Elite engineers in the security partner community, I built this first-gen electronic badge using an off-the-shelf [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) and some laser cut/etched acrylic fantastically done by [@ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/). 

The result is available here: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/briansak/status/1186090275019481089).
